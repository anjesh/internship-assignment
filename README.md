## Internship assignment for Android

### What you need to do?

* Take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) if you haven’t already.
* Create a private repo called “yipl-android-assignment” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Do as instructed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple number of commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo

### Assignment

Implement a simple listing and detail showcase application using the following APIs:

* For listing: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/
* For details: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments

Make sure you use [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html) for listing content, if you're not familiar with RecyclerView, you can have a look at [sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-RecyclerView) projects. Once loaded, the data (both listing and detail) should persist. Any persistence mechanism can be used, i.e., cache or database. 

Design as you wish.

### Criteria for judgement

* Object Oriented approach used in project.
* Naming conventions for XML and Java files.
* Proper use of ViewGroup(s) and View(s).
* Proper use of Android API(s).
* Project structure.

### Bonus points

* If you can use relevant 'Material Design' components in your application.
* If you write readme file with screenshots and short description of your application.
